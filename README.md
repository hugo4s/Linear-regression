# Python Dictionaries: Linear Regression Project

## Overview
The Linear Regression Project focuses on implementing a version of linear regression in Python to analyze and model the relationship between variables, specifically to predict the behavior of bouncy balls in a ball pit. This project utilizes fundamental concepts of linear algebra and Python programming.

## Project Goals
1. Implement Linear Regression: Develop functions to calculate error, try different slopes and intercepts, and make predictions using linear regression.
2. Data Analysis: Analyze and interpret data points to find the best-fitting line.
3. Optimization: Optimize the selection of slope and intercept parameters to minimize error.
4. Prediction: Utilize the linear regression model to predict outcomes for new data points.

## Prerequisites
Completion of basic Python programming concepts and understanding of mathematical principles involved in linear regression is recommended before undertaking this project.

## Project Requirements
1. Calculating Error: Implement functions to calculate error between data points and a line.
2. Try a Bunch of Slopes and Intercepts: Iterate through different slope and intercept values to find the combination that minimizes error.
3. Making Predictions: Use the optimized slope and intercept values to make predictions for new data points.
